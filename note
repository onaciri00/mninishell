so first split everthing till you found pipe that will be a comound
    (incase of pipe inside qouate change theme to unwritable charchter)
than look for redirction 

exit if piped in should termante the programme
 ask if you shoud handle ';'

 if > fil1 > fil2 they should noth have the output of ls ame of (infile) cat < <
 EXPAND in any time was given exept 
 pipe first last

cat<Makefiel|ls -l

1 - split pipe 
{
    cat<$USER
    ls -l
}

2-add sapce
3-expand{
    cat < onaciri
    turn it linked list and remove files nodes
    ls -l
}

4 - get files
{
    remove quotes from files names
    fill the fucking linked list
}

remove quotes and get cmd and arguments

1 qouate removed if twice 


1 check the first charchter if it is than replace letter ahead 
2else look  for it than put all charchter ahead -1 position 
if more come just keep skeping tell you find letter if ended thand put \0 in the last time you find it

"""d""hfd""hfhd""gfhj"""hdf"h"
"" handklle

herdoc == "limter"-> no expand for $limter and inside it




look for the letter ahead (\0 || sytVal)
is it normall or inside a double quote
